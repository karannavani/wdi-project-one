> [Play Flying Solo](https://karannavani.github.io/wdi-project-one/)

## Goal
To build a fun and interesting game, using Javascript or jQuery for DOM manipulation.

## Game
Flying Solo is a spin on the classic addictive game â€“ Flappy Bird, with a Star Wars theme.

The aim of the game is to fly Han Solo (or any other character) between the column of pipes without hitting them. 

There is a single player mode and a multiplayer mode.
## Technologies Used
* HTML 5
* CSS 3
* Javascript (ECMAScript 6)
* jQuery
* Github
* Git
* Google Fonts
* CSS Animations

## Approach Taken

1. My challenge was to figure out what would be the best way to implement this in a browser using Javascript. I decided that having the character fixed on the x axis and having the pipes move toward it would be an efficient way to get started.
